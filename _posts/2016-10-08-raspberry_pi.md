<p>I participated in the York Raspberry Jam & Maker Event at the National STEM Centre. Together with other CS students we presented our raspberry projects, which we delivered for the "Raspberry Pi in the classroom" event -- the idea was to design projects which could be repeated in schools with children learning to use Scratch on the Pi.</p>

<p>The video above is a demo of my project called "Magnetic checkers" - the goal was to move metallic checker pieces around the field using an electromagnet. The machine ended up resembling a simple 3D printer: 3 stepper motors, one moving base in axis X, two moving the head (magnet) in Y and Z axes. Software allows user to control machine manually and give simple tasks for automatic control (i.e. "move piece from A2 to E7").</p>

<p>Software: Scratch for high-level control, Python for sending high-frequency PWM signal to GPIO pins.</p>

<p>Hardware: Meccano structural parts, x3 NEMA 17 motors, x3 A4988 Pololu drivers, 12V 6W electromanget, Raspberry Pi, 3 PSUs.</p>
