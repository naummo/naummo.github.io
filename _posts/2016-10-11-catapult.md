<p>In 2016, I organized a workshop in a scientific summer school, where we built four auto-aiming catapults with a group of 16 years-old students.</p>
<p>The catapults are based on Arduino Uno, Tamiya Twin-Motor Gear Boxes and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor; the frame is made of plywood.</p>
<p>The goal of the workshop was to learn how to operate the wood workshop tools, and learn the mechanisms of motors, microcontrollers and ultrasonic sensors.</p>
