FYI, a Regular License should be used only for a single application (single website / single client project) on which your end-users are not charged for.

                  <p>
                     This template is an advanced Jekyll template powered by some modern features such as CSS3, HTML5 and AJAX to render the styles, colors, fonts and some additional visual enhancements. LESS and AJAX will work only from server side, means  <strong>you have to upload all files to a real web hosting server in order to view proper colours and fonts rendering of this template.</strong> If you just test them from your local computer you will not be able to see proper colours or fonts, but this is not at all any errors. Please upload the template to a web server and edit it there. 
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">1. Why this documentation is very important?</h3>
                  <p> We are sure that we have covered all the essential instructions needed to setup a nice website as you see in our template’s live preview. We expect you to read this user guide before you open any support request (if you ask about things already present in this guide, you will be gently asked to read this again</p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">2. If I need help, will you provide free support?</h3>
					<p> <strong>Yes,</strong> we have a dedicated <a href="mailto:themeix@gmail.com">support system</a>  where we offer free support even though providing support is not mandatory for themeforest authors. Our support is applicable only for issues and bugs within our product live previews (nonedited version of the template). We do NOT provide free customisation services in the scope of free support.  
					</p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">3.  What kind of support are you providing?</h3>
					<p>We offer free support for our products where we can help you ﬁx issues within our code (if any) and assist you on template setup (in some cases if the task is minimal).  Please note support is not applicable for third party jQuery plugins and GPL code components (because they are not created or maintained by us). Also support is not applicable to issues or bugs happening on your edited version of the template. We are not offering any debugging service on your edited websites.

					</p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">4. When can I expect a response from you?</h3>
					<p>Our team will be online during 08.30 to 17.30 on Monday – Friday (GMT + 6.00, Dhaka). For support request we usually make a response within 24 to 48 hours. Due to the complex nature of some queries, responses can’t be guaranteed a speciﬁc turn-around time, but we value each user and we will surely get back to you. In case if we experience heavy load of support tickets we will announce the status on Twitter.
					</p>
                  <h3 class="highlight">5. If I need to customize this template will you offer it?</h3>

                  <h1>Directory & Installation</h1>
                  <p>
                    The following guide assumes you have some knowledge of the Jekyll platform, including setting up of its prerequisites and a suitable server environment. Further information on this can be found in the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll Documentation</a>.
                    
                     <br> 
					<h3 class="highlight">How to install theme</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>Login to your hosting environment via (S)FTP, or preferred file transfer method. </li>
					<li>2Navigate to the directory you wish to install the blog. If you have an already existing Jekyll install its recommended to start a new blog, and transfer the files over to the new install.</li>
					<li> Copy the contents of 'JekyllX' into the newly created directory.</li><br/>
				
					
					<li>Edit the _config.yml file, more information on the available options can be found in the Customization section of this document</li><br/>
					 
</ul>
					<h3 class="highlight">Pages</h3>
				  If you don’t want file extensions (.html) to appear in your page URLs (file extensions are the default), you can choose a permalink style that has a trailing slash instead of a file extension. More details here, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/">https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/</a>
		 <img style="margin-bottom:30px" src="img/file1.png" alt="File" />
		
		 
		<h3 class="highlight">Posts</h3>
				 	To create a new post, all you need to do is create a file in the _posts directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: 
		<p style="font-weight:bold">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</p>
		Example : 2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md <br/>
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md <br/><br/>
		 <img style="margin-bottom:30px" src="img/file2.png" alt="File" />

 Within the index page is the post list. Each post has an excerpt area below the title which can be adjusted to show as much content as you wish per post. In order to set the cutoff area, requires adding the following tag <code><!--more--></code>into your post. Anything above the tag placement will be shown in the postlist, anything below will be shown on the individual post page.
 </p>
 Example : <br/>
 
  <img style="margin-top:30px" src="img/file4.png" alt="File" />
 

 
               </div>
               <div id="five" class="content fade">
                  <h1> Layout</h1>

                  <h1> Replacing Placeholder Images </h1>
                   
				   <p>Once you download the template from themeforest you may notice that Live preview images (as you see in our demo) is not included in the pack. This is because live preview images are properties of their owners and photographers, we are unable to redistribute them. We have provided placeholder images instead of such stock images, we have generated placeholders via an online service: http://lab.csschopper.com/placeholder/ </p>
				   <img src="img/800x400.png" alt="" />
				   <p>Now, you have to make your own image with a dimension as: <br />WIDTH = 800 <br /> Height = 400px  <br />Format = JPG.  <br />and replace the URL as your own image. <br /> For example: <pre><xmp><img src= “ your_image_here.jpg ” /></xmp></pre></p>
				   
				   <p>Like this you can simply replace any placholder image with your own images with similar dimensions and ﬁle format. Also keep them in the same directory structure if speciﬁed in the markup or CSS rules for such images.
</p>
<p><small>But in some cases the images will be supplied by JS ﬁles, for example in Fullscreen BG Slideshows. So please read the documentation information related to each module to locate the actual images supplied via their code.</small>
