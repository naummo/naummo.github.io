<p class="lead">I am a <span style="white-space:nowrap;">PhD candidate</span> in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">programming languages</span> and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">deep learning</span> at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>.</p>

My PhD is supervised by <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Christophe Dubach](https://cdubach.bitbucket.io/)</span> and co-supervised by <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Michel Steuwer](https://michel.steuwer.info/)</span>, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Michael O'Boyle](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mob/)</span> and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Kenneth Heafield](https://kheafield.com/)</span>.

I am a member of the [Compiler and Architecture Design Group (CArD)](https://www.icsa.inf.ed.ac.uk/compilers/), the [Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/) and a visiting student at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) and [McGill School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/).

My project focuses on **optimizing compilation** techniques that benefit from functional intermediate representation (IR) with **deep neural nets** and **GPUs** as a case study. I also worked on this topic with [Ryota Tomioka](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ryoto/) while on an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge. My other interests include software/hardware codesign for DL: while interning at ARM Research Cambridge, I worked with [Giacomo Gabrielli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giacomogabrielli/) and [Ali Zaidi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimustafazaidi/) on a compiler that generates FPGA designs in the Spatial HLS language with LSTM networks as a case study. I also participate in the teaching of algorithms, machine learning, Java and cognitive science.
