My interests and experience are compilers (optimising compilation for deep learning) and programming languages (expressive type systems are great).
Broadly, I am in love with complex systems: the [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) ecosystem is a good example in PL, and deep neural architectures -- in AI.

My PhD thesis (2023) ([PDF](https://naumsmogers.me/assets/other/doctoral_thesis_mogers.pdf), [slides](https://naumsmogers.me/assets/other/viva_intro.pdf)) is in programming languages and compilers for deep learning.
I did my PhD at the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)</span> ([ICSA](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/)), co-supervised by <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Christophe Dubach](https://cdubach.bitbucket.io/)</span>, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Michel Steuwer](https://michel.steuwer.info/)</span>, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Michael O'Boyle](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mob/)</span> and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Kenneth Heafield](https://kheafield.com/)</span>.
My PhD examiners were <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Murray Cole](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/murray-cole)</span> and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[Jeremy Singer](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jsinger/)</span>.

My PhD project focused on **optimizing compilation** techniques that benefit from functional intermediate representation (IR) with **deep neural nets** and **GPUs** as a case study. I also worked on this topic with [Ryota Tomioka](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ryoto/) while on an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge. As a research intern at ARM Research Cambridge, I worked on software/hardware codesign for DL with [Giacomo Gabrielli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giacomogabrielli/) and [Ali Zaidi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimustafazaidi/): specifically, I worked on a compiler that generates FPGA designs in the Spatial HLS language with LSTM networks as a case study. I also participated in the teaching of algorithms, machine learning, Java and cognitive science.
