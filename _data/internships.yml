  company: "ARM Research, Cambridge"
  desc: My project while at the ARM Architecture Research group is focused on using rewriting compilation to generate optimal hardware accelerator designs for a given application such as LSTM. To this end, I extended the intermediate representation and the compiler of the Lift compiler to generate HDL descriptions in the Spatial language.
