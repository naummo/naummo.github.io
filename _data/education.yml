- title: Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in <br>Optimising Compilation of Machine Learning Models for Heterogeneous Hardware
  year: 2017 - 2020
  university: "Supervised by Christophe Dubach @ University of Edinburgh"
  desc: The focus of my research is rewrite rules-based compilation of the functional domain-specific language Lift for DNNs into OpenCL. The goal is to abstract DNNs from hardware without losing neither device-specific optimisations, nor performance-preserving portability. My approach involves expressing DNNs functionally, encoding parametrised optimisations as rewrite rules and exploring a huge search space of optimisations and their parameters. In addition to NVIDIA GPUs, I targeted ARM Mali GPUs for the yearlong collaboration with Huawei, where I cross-compiled DNN-code for HiKey.

  year: 2016 - 2017
  university: "Supervised by Christophe Dubach @ University of Edinburgh"
  desc: Within this project, I expressed a CNN in the functional language Lift and explored the optimisational space of data tiling and grouping and weighting sequentialization, exploiting coalesced memory accesses and data locality. I presented a poster on this work at the Google PhD Summit in Munich.
